  <h1>Prevention – Guidance Before Harm</h1>
  <p>Our mission is to provide a safe, anonymous space for individuals who may be considering harmful actions — toward themselves or others — to reach out and connect with trusted family, mentors, professionals, or trained volunteers (“Angels”). Early communication can prevent tragedies and help people make better choices.</p>

    <h2>How It Works</h2>
    <p>Users can send messages anonymously to family, crisis hotlines, or trusted volunteers. Each message creates an opportunity for intervention, guidance, and support before harm occurs.</p>
    <p>The platform prioritizes privacy and safety: identities are revealed only if the sender chooses.</p>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
    <p>Early intervention saves lives and prevents harm. By encouraging communication and providing structured support, we reduce the likelihood of crises escalating.</p>
    <p>We also provide educational resources, tips for family and friends, and guidance on how to support someone in distress or at risk of taking harmful actions.</p>
